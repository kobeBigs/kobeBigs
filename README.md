### Hello, I am Kobe! ðŸ‘‹

You can also call me **Bigs**! I am a DevOps Engineer, Product Developer, and experimentalist who loves exploring the intersection of technology and art.
I love troubleshooting **K8s**, writing CLI scripts and apps using **Bash**, **Python**, **Perl** and **Go**. In my spare time, I tinker with #raspi and #arduino, create art with Processing, or head out to learn and gather stories with my camera. 

Currently, I am delving deeper into **Go**, aiming to develop simple, handy tools for my daily DevOps tasks. 

I believe in simple acts of kindness.
