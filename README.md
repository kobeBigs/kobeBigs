### Hello, I am Kobe! ðŸ‘‹

You can also call me **Bigs**! I am a DevOps Engineer, Product Developer and experimentalist that loves to explore the intersection between technology and art.
I love troubleshooting K8s, writing cli scripts/apps using **Bash**, **Python** and **Perl**. In my spare time I tinker with raspi and arduino, make art in processing or go out to learn/gather stories with my camera. 

I am currently revising and exploring more in **Go**, looking to write simple handy tools to use in my daily DevOps tasks. 

I believe in simple acts of kindness.
